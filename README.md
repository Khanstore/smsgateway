# SMSGateway.me Client for API v4
Recently the implementation of the smsgateway.me for sending/receiving SMS's has changed
and broke the library that I was using, so I decided to make my own version

# Usage
TBD (Add docs also)

# Support
I decided to implement only the endpoints that I need, but if you need anything else, please make a PR :)
